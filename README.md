Arch Package Installer (A wrapper over pacaur).

It provides some extra facility over pacaur such as search in both arch repository and AUR and install them selectively (like yaourt).

# DEPENDENCIES

It depends on the following packages:

1. pacaur
2. pkgfile (optional)

# INSTALL

Copy the script to */usr/bin/*:

```bash
chmod +x arpi
sudo cp arpi /usr/bin/
```

# USAGE

It can be used the same way as pacaur. The only difference is that some options come with extra functionalities. An example:
