.SH NAME
.PP
\f[B]pacget\f[] \-\- A wrapper around \f[B]pacaur\f[] to mimic
yaourt\[aq]s search feature.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]pacget\f[] [operation] [options] [target(s)]
.PP
\f[B]pacget\f[] [packages_to_install]
.PP
All arguments are forwarded to \f[B]pacaur\f[] excluding some special
ones which are processed separately to provide some extended
functionalities over pacaur (https://github.com/rmarquis/pacaur).
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]pacget\f[] works the same way as \f[B]pacaur\f[] and consequently
\f[B]pacman\f[].
All basic operations are processed with \f[B]pacaur\f[] which wraps
around \f[B]pacman\f[] and thus you can use the same knowledge of
\f[B]pacman\f[] and \f[B]pacaur\f[].
.PP
\f[B]pacget\f[] extends some operations provided by pacaur, such as the
search functionality.
\f[B]pacget\f[]\[aq]s \f[C]\-s\f[] operations searches both the official
repo and AUR for the given search term and allows installing packages
interactively (kinda like
yaourt (https://github.com/archlinuxfr/yaourt)).
.SH DEPENDENCIES
.PP
It depends on the following packages:
.IP "1." 3
pacaur
.IP "2." 3
pkgfile (optional)
.SH USAGE
.PP
It can be used the same way as \f[C]pacaur\f[] (consequently
\f[C]pacman\f[]).
The only difference is that some options come with extra facilities.
.PP
\f[B]Examples:\f[]
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#\ The\ following\ installs\ the\ package\ linux\-lts
pacget\ \-Sy\ linux\-lts

#\ The\ following\ is\ a\ short\ form\ to\ pacget\ \-S\ linux\-lts
pacget\ linux\-lts

#\ Upgrade:
pacget\ \-Syu
#\ etc..\ same\ as\ pacman\ and\ pacaur.

#\ The\ following\ command\ will\ search\ for\ gimp\ and
#\ give\ you\ option\ to\ select\ packages\ to\ install
pacget\ \-s\ gimp\

.SH PACGET OPTIONS
.TP
.B \f[B]\-s, \-\-search\f[] \f[I]search_term\f[]
Search for \f[I]search_term\f[] in both official Archlinux repositories
and AUR, then install packages selectively and interactively.
This produces output like \f[B]yaourt\f[] and lets you select the
packages by number (e.g 1,2,3 or 1 2 3) and range (1\-3 or 3\-1) to
install them.
